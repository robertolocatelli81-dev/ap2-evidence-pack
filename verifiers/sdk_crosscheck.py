"""THIRD verifier, written by other people: Google's AP2 SDK over the `sd-jwt` reference implementation.

The differential oracle compares this repository's two verifiers, and both were written by the same author — so an
error in READING the specification is invisible to it: the same misreading lands in Python and in Node, and they agree.
This script closes that gap for the layer the SDK covers, the SD-JWT mandate itself. For every artifact of a pack it
asks `ap2.sdk.sdjwt.sd_jwt.verify()` (Google's wrapper around `sd_jwt.verifier.SDJWTVerifier`, the reference
implementation of RFC 9901, whose PyPI metadata names Daniel Fett — one of that RFC's three authors — as its author) whether the token verifies under the snapshotted key, and compares two things with what our
reference says about the same artifact:

  1. the VERDICT  — accept / refuse;
  2. the RESOLVED CLAIMS — the payload after disclosure resolution, which is where a misread digest rule would hide:
     a verdict can agree while the two stacks disclose different claims.

What it does NOT compare: the container (digest, bindings, producer signature, RFC 3161, policy, provenance class) —
the SDK has no notion of any of it, and our packs are the only place it exists. Read this as a cross-check of the
mandate layer only: of the six verification steps of SPEC §6, the signature and the disclosure resolution inside
step 2, and nothing else.

Usage:
    AP2_SDK_PATH=/path/to/AP2/code/sdk/python  python3 verifiers/sdk_crosscheck.py [pack.json ...]

Needs `jwcrypto`, `sd-jwt` and `pydantic` (the SDK's dependencies), which this repository does not require: run it in a
venv of its own. Exit 1 on any disagreement.
