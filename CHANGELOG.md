## Corrections (2026-09-26)

- Small-order keys allow a forgery on any message, not on "a share of messages" (correction to the 1.2.1 notes). The
  1.2.1 note said that, for the small-order points other than the identity, a forgery holds only "on a share of
  messages". By the verification equation, that is true of one fixed construction (R = identity, S = 0), but it
  understated the risk: with any small-order public key A, of order n = 2, 4 or 8, anyone can produce a signature on any
  message. Pick S and a guess g for k mod n, set R = [S]B − [g]A, compute k = H(R ‖ A ‖ M) mod L as the verifier does,
  and retry until k ≡ g (mod n); each try succeeds with probability about 1/n. Measured on 2026-09-26 with curve
  arithmetic written for the measurement, not this repository's code: for each of the 8 small-order public keys, a
  signature on one message chosen in advance verified under OpenSSL, through Python `cryptography` (1 to 16 tries) and
  through Node 22 `crypto` (1 to 17 tries) — the same backend, so one measurement, not two independent ones. In the
  Python probe, the same construction against an ordinary key verified 0 times in 2000 (null control). The refusal of
  these keys added in 1.2.1 is unchanged; this corrects only the description of what it prevents. The source comments
  that repeated the wording are corrected too.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-09-26 — small-order keys refused; the evidence file must be a regular file

Numbers dated 25/09 in this note come from the author's measurement records, which are not part of this repository,
and were not re-measured for 1.2.1 except where a 26/09 figure is given; the tests and oracle cases for each rule are
in the repository. Found by the 25/09/2026 malformed-input review (four independent reviewers).

- **Small-order Ed25519 keys refused (25/09/2026).** With the identity key as public key, R=identity, S=0 is a valid
  signature on every message. For the other small-order points, under the cofactorless equation that both verifiers
  use, such a forgery holds on a share of messages (the hash depends on R, so not on every one; not measured here);
  under cofactored verification it would hold on every message. A non-canonical encoding (y >= p) is refused because
  the key has no unique encoding. Measured with the identity key in both verifiers, the Python reference
  (`cryptography`) and the JS verifier (Node) — both OpenSSL-backed, so this is one measurement of one backend, not
  two independent ones: a forged producer signature made that way, with that key pinned by the relying party, was
  PASS; after the change both refuse it. Both verifiers now refuse those keys with the same list (8 small-order
  encodings, 2 with the sign bit on x = 0, every y >= p; checked against curve arithmetic on 25/09: 0 disagreements
  on 48 special and 200 000 random keys).
- **The evidence file must be a regular file.** Re-measured on 25/09 on 1.2.0 (`040a1fa`) before any change, under
  an RLIMIT_DATA of 1500 MiB: a FIFO in place of the evidence file blocked both verifiers (no receipt after 30 s); a
  symlink to `/dev/zero` passed the 64 MiB check — a device reports size 0 — and was read until memory ran out
  (Python `MemoryError` traceback exit 1, Node abort `std::bad_alloc`); a directory was refused with an OS error name
  (`IsADirectoryError` / `EISDIR`). Both verifiers now open the file without blocking (`O_NONBLOCK | O_NOCTTY`), keep
  it only if the OPEN descriptor is a regular file (`fstat`), and read at most 64 MiB + 1 byte: a FIFO, a device or a
  directory is the refusal `unreadable evidence file: not a regular file`; a file above the bound stays `exceeds`, and
  by construction also when it grows while being read (no oracle case exercises a growing file). SPEC §3.1 states
  the rule. Measured 26/09 on the release commit (peak RSS of the child, `getrusage`): a file of 64 MiB + 1 byte and
  a symlink to `/dev/zero` are refused at 37 MiB (Python) / 49 MiB (Node), the same peak as a usage error — the
  interpreter's baseline, not a cost of the refusal.
- **Not fixed: the 64 MiB bound limits what is read, not what parsing costs** (measured 25/09/2026): under an
  RLIMIT_DATA of 1500 MiB a 64 MiB file of tiny values (`[{},…]`, `[[],…]`) ends in a Python `MemoryError` traceback
  with no receipt and a Node abort, and Node aborts on a single 64 MiB string too (its strict parser). Closing it
  needs a smaller size bound or a bound on the number of values: a change to SPEC §3.1, left to the author.
- **Oracle.** Four cases with a FIXED refusal reason that both verifiers must give — `file-fifo`,
  `file-devzero-symlink`, `file-directory`, `file-one-byte-over-the-bound` — run with a 20 s timeout and an
  RLIMIT_DATA of 1500 MiB per child, and a positive control `file-exactly-at-the-bound` (the valid vector padded with
  spaces to exactly 64 MiB, which changes no digest). Positive controls must now PASS: through 1.2.0 the oracle only
  counted them, so two verifiers that refused a positive control alike were an agreement (ablation: both verifiers
  made to refuse a file of exactly 64 MiB → 0 disagreements with that check removed, 1 with it). Measured 25/09: 144
  cases / 0 disagreements on 1.2.0 with its own oracle; the new oracle, 149 cases: 0 disagreements after the change,
  3 on 1.2.0 (`file-fifo` BLOCKED in both, `file-devzero-symlink` no receipt in both, `file-directory` with the OS
  reason). In both oracles, 4 known divergences are declared and matched field by field, except the freshly
  generated x5c leaf (`openssl`-dependent chain and TSA checks, the same four since 1.1.0); they are not counted as
  disagreements.
- **Ablation (25/09),** each control removed alone in each verifier: the regular-file check is deliberately
  redundant — a `stat` before `open` and an `fstat` on the descriptor back each other up, so removing either alone
  turns nothing red, and removing both turns the 3 file-object cases red; `O_NONBLOCK` removed with the `stat` →
  `file-fifo`; the `bound + 1` read cap is covered by the `fstat` size check (it guards only a file that grows while
  read). The separate `lax_python_ablation.sh` ("every strict layer RED alone") covers the parsing layers, not these
  file checks.
- **Tests:** `test_ap2_evidence.py` 27 → 29 on 25/09 (the FIFO/`/dev/zero`/directory test red on 1.2.0; the bound
  test green there too — a valid file at exactly the bound must pass, before and after).

- **The third-verifier bench (`verifiers/sdk_crosscheck.py --hostile`) opened the new file-object cases.** It reuses
  the oracle's hostile corpus and used to read each file with a plain `json.load(open())`. Measured 2026-09-26 locally:
  on the symlink to `/dev/zero` it read until the process was killed (SIGKILL, sender not identified) after 14.1 s at a
  peak of 5165 MiB. The CI runner of the first 1.2.1 push (run 36258094086, commit `bfe6827`) received a shutdown
  signal 10 s into that same step; the runner's own reason is not visible in the log, and the local measurement is
  what ties the two. A FIFO would have blocked the bench (by the semantics of `open()`; not run). The FIFO,
  `/dev/zero` and directory cases are now left out of that bench, counted and printed: they test a refusal before
  reading, and this bench hands the third stack already-parsed objects, so there is nothing on that side to compare.
  After the fix: 7.9 s, peak 237 MiB; 138 artifacts compared (16 from the vectors, 122 hostile), 89 claim-sets,
  0 undeclared disagreements. 1.2.0 had 136 and 87: the two added artifacts and claim-sets are the valid pack padded
  to exactly the bound (removing that case reproduces 136 / 87).
- **Release assets: the SBOM license was wrong.** The CycloneDX SBOM attached to the 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 1.2.0
  releases declares `AGPL-3.0-or-later`; the package is `Apache-2.0` (LICENSE, `pyproject.toml`). The release script
  had the license hard-coded; from 1.2.1 it reads it from `pyproject.toml`, and fails (exit 2) if `pyproject.toml`
  carries no license. The earlier assets are left as published: replacing a published asset would silently change
  what users already downloaded. This entry is the correction. `SHA256SUMS` now lists every file in the release
  directory (itself excluded), not only the wheel and the sdist.

Re-run on 26/09/2026 on the release commit: `test_ap2_evidence.py` 30 tests (the 29 above plus the small-order key
test), oracle 149 cases / 0 disagreements (4 declared divergences), `type_fuzz.py` 1390/1390 inputs answered with a
verdict instead of a crash (695 mutations × 2 verifiers; it substitutes field types, not files).

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-23 — a third verifier, written by other people

Every measurement in this repository until now came from two verifiers written by one author. Both reviewers of 1.1.2
named the same limit independently — a misreading of the specification lands identically in Python and in Node, and the
oracle records it as perfect agreement. `verifiers/sdk_crosscheck.py` closes it for the layer it can reach: it runs
Google's AP2 SDK (commit `e1ea56db72a6`, the head of its `main` on 23/09/2026) over `sd-jwt` 0.10.4, the reference
implementation whose PyPI metadata names Daniel Fett — one of RFC 9901's three authors — and the latest release on PyPI, against the same tokens, and
compares the verdict AND the claims each stack resolves.

- **Measured 23/09/2026:** eight vectors alone, 16 artifacts, same verdict and same claim names and values on all of
  them. Vectors plus hostile corpus: 136 artifacts compared (16 of them from the vectors), 87 claim-sets compared,
  **0 undeclared disagreements**, and none in the direction that would signal a hole here — nothing this repository
  accepts and the third stack refuses.
- **The third stack also ISSUES.** Comparing opinions about tokens produced here cannot see a reading shared by both
  local verifiers, because the corpus comes from that same reading. So the SDK mints tokens — with and without decoy
  digests — and this repository's PYTHON reference verifies them and resolves the same claims (the Node verifier is
  not run on them). Both pass, and the bench asserts the emitted shape instead of describing it: one
  `{"...": <digest>}` array-element placeholder per issued token, a shape no hostile file exercises. Nested and recursive disclosures and delegation
  chains are still not cross-checked, and the README says so.
- **One declared divergence, with its clause.** A presentation carrying a disclosure that matches no digest: this
  repository refuses it, the third stack accepts it and returns the payload with that claim dropped. RFC 9901 §7.1
  step 5 requires rejection. No forged claim passes either way; the divergence is the verdict, not the content.
- **Three cases that are nobody's defect,** and an earlier draft of this entry got the reason wrong by calling the RFC
  "silent". It is not: `_sd` that is not an array of digest strings and an array placeholder whose value is not a
  digest string are MUSTs of §4.2.4.1 and §4.2.4.2 addressed to the Issuer, and §7.1 step 3.b collects only well-formed
  shapes while step 3.e removes every `_sd` key — so ignoring the malformed part is what the RFC's verification
  algorithm prescribes. This format rejects instead, a stricter choice. The bench now prints the payload the third
  stack returns, so that sentence is copied from a measurement: `{"...": [1]}` comes back as an ordinary array element
  inside the verified payload, a malformed `_sd` simply disappears, and `_sd: null` is refused by BOTH. SPEC §6 step 2
  says which of these rules come from the RFC and which are this format's choice.
- **Positive controls and their own ablation,** because a bench that cannot go red measures nothing: a flipped
  signature must be refused, a rewritten disclosure's forged value must never be disclosed, a wrong key must flip the
  third stack's verdict — and `AP2_XCHECK_SEED_DIVERGENCE=1` corrupts the key handed to the third stack so that a
  disagreement is actually reported and the run exits 1.
- **Six defects in this bench, found by two review passes and re-measured before fixing.** Its verdict for our side
  read `signature_ok` alone, a proxy for the artifact's verdict: on `claims-mismatch` it printed "both accept" over an
  artifact this verifier rejects. Three hostile files it cannot even read (a BOM, a 100000-deep nesting, a raw
  non-UTF-8 byte) were skipped in silence, quietly shrinking the denominator. The wrong-key control passed when the
  key could not be loaded at all, testing nothing. The seeded-divergence run printed "none in the direction 'we accept,
  a third implementation refuses'" while the seeded divergence was in precisely that direction. The CI ablation checked
  only a non-zero exit, which a crash also produces, and now requires the seeded `[DIFF]` in the output. And the
  citation for `_sd_alg` said §7.1 step 3.d; it is step 2.d.
- **A false sentence shipped in 1.1.2 and earlier,** found by the same review: the README named the oracle's three
  positive controls as non-ASCII, a fresh-key pack and "the CA-issued `x5c` leaf under `--trust-anchor`". Measured
  against `POSITIVE_CONTROLS` in the oracle, the third is `must-created_utc-ok`; the `x5c` leaf is one of the 113
  hostile files. The README now names them from that set and says the sentence was wrong.
- **What it does not cover, with the counts:** 32 packs refused here at the file level and 15 artifacts refused at a
  layer the third stack has no notion of (key provenance, and the `resolved_claims` the file records) get no
  third-stack opinion; 2 more carry a key block that is not a key, so nothing could be handed over; 6 artifacts are refused under the §3.1 profile this format declares
  stricter; on 7 packs the KB-JWT's `aud`/`nonce` cannot be read, so its binding could not be compared (where they can
  be read they are passed through, so the key-binding signature and its `sd_hash` are checked too); 3 hostile files are
  unreadable by the bench. Of the six verification steps of SPEC §6 it covers the signature and the disclosure
  resolution inside step 2, nothing else.
- **`verifiers/type_fuzz.py`, which the cross-check's own result asked for.** Finding that 10 of the third stack's 17
  refusals are uncaught internal errors raises the same question here, and that one is this repository's to answer:
  every field of a valid pack (88) replaced by each of eight hostile types is 695 hostile mutations, answered with a
  verdict 1390/1390 times by the two verifiers (nine substitutions leave the pack identical to the valid one and are
  counted apart), where an answer means an object with a boolean `valid` on stdout and nothing on stderr.
  `test_hostile_files_…_never_tracebacks` already covered ten hand-picked file-level shapes against the Python
  reference as a library, and the differential oracle already ran both verifiers as subprocesses on the 113 hostile
  files with a non-JSON answer as a crash marker; what this adds is the fields one at a time and a positive control
  for the crash detector itself, gated on the exact number of crashes that control must produce. The harness ships a deliberately
  crashing verifier and refuses to measure anything unless it catches it first.
- **Two more defects of the same shrinking-denominator shape, found by the third review pass.** Two artifacts whose
  key block is not a key were skipped with no counter at all — in no total, while a bucket label named their case —
  and the declared divergence printed the `sd-jwt` version as a hand-written `0.10.4` inside a line the bench emits as
  a measurement, which would have printed that string whatever version CI resolved. The version is now read from the
  installed package, and those two artifacts have their own line.
- The workflow gains a job for the cross-check and a step that ablates it, plus a step for the no-crash property. The outcome of the run belongs in the
  release notes, measured, not here.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-09-22 — the vocabulary matches the specification (committed, never tagged: it ships inside 1.2.0)

**Independent competitive analysis by Gemini 3.1 Pro and Fable 5.1, run in parallel after publication.** Fable went
outside the repository, read the current AP2 specification and the projects competing with this one, and found the thing
eleven review rounds could not: the public vocabulary was a version behind. Measured in `google-agentic-commerce/AP2` on
2026-09-22: "Intent Mandate" and "Cart Mandate" occur **zero** times in `docs/ap2/`, while Checkout Mandate occurs 63
times and Payment Mandate 84. The README opened with "AP2-style Intent / Cart / Payment mandate chains", the sample
generator wrote `intent.sdjwt` and `cart.sdjwt`, and the CI gate built from them.

- README, samples, CLI help, tests and the CI gate now use **Checkout** and **Payment** mandates, with the `vct` values
  of the current spec (`mandate.checkout.open.1`, `mandate.payment.1`).
- The README states what was measured against that spec today: a delegation chain from `docs/ap2/checkout_mandate.md` —
  `delegate_payload` carrying an array disclosure — parses and resolves here unchanged, returning the delegate with its
  `vct`, `constraints` and `cnf`; and it states what this package does NOT do, which the reference SDK does: validate
  the `vct` against the mandate type.

Both analyses also listed what no competitor has (measured by them as zero occurrences in the repositories of
MandateBound, Verifiable Intent and the AP2 SDK): the hybrid ML-DSA-65 producer signature, the offline-verified RFC 3161
anchor, a second independent verifier with a differential oracle and declared divergences, and normative vectors with
expected verdicts. Those claims are recorded here, not in the README, until they are measured in this repository by a
script anyone can run.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-22 — the dependency is declared, and CI tests the distributed package

**Independent review by Gemini 3.1 Pro, after publication** (the review attacked the framing, not the code, which is what
three passes of a same-family reviewer could not do). Two findings were measured and acted on here; a third is recorded
below because it cannot be fixed without changing the sealed scope.

- **CI tested the repository, never the package.** Every step ran `python test_*.py` inside the checkout with
  `cryptography` installed by the workflow — which is exactly why a missing dependency declaration survived four releases.
  CI now builds the wheel, installs it ALONE in a clean venv, imports it and verifies a vector from there.
- **The README did not name the standards that solve the neighbouring problem.** ASiC (ETSI EN 319 162) and PAdES/XAdES
  LTV already embed certificates, revocation data and timestamps for long-term preservation of signed documents, and any
  eIDAS validator reads them. The README now says so, says when to use those instead, and states the cost of not being a
  standardised container.
- **Recorded, not fixed:** the sealed scope says that for the "existed before a quantum adversary" claim you still need a
  trusted time anchor. Measured: the probe TSA — like essentially every TSA in service — signs with `ecdsa-with-SHA256`.
  An adversary able to forge the ES256 mandate signature can forge that timestamp too, so the anchor does not carry the
  claim unless the TSA itself is post-quantum or the token is renewed under RFC 4998 before the algorithm falls. The
  sentence is not false as written ("you still need") but it is incomplete, and correcting it changes the pinned scope
  hash and therefore rejects every existing pack: it belongs to the next format version, not to a patch release.



`cryptography` was never listed in `[project].dependencies`, in any release: installing from the index produced a package
whose first import failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cryptography'`. The README said to install it by
hand, which is a documented workaround, not a working install — measured in a clean venv right after publishing 1.1.0,
which is what the clean-install step of the release procedure is for. No change to the format, the verifiers, the vectors
or the sealed scope: `ap2-evidence-pack/1.0` packs verify exactly as under 1.1.0.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-22 — acceptance profile, one CLI grammar, an independent verifier and a differential oracle

Propagation of the verifier-hygiene classes found in the cra-evidence / omega-evidence / cryptovalid reviews (21/09/2026),
the hygiene classes of the first four bullets were measured on the 1.0.2 verifier first: that day's oracle was red on 97
of its 124 cases there. Later rounds found defects 1.0.2 could not exhibit at all, having neither a second verifier nor
the policy flags.

- **Acceptance profile of the evidence file** (SPEC §3.1): non-UTF-8, BOM, >64 MiB, non-object, duplicate keys, floats,
  integers beyond ±(2^53−1), `NaN`/`Infinity`, nesting >512, lone surrogate escapes are refused with a receipt
  (`valid: false`, `refused: <reason>`) — never a traceback. 1.0.2 crashed on non-UTF-8 (`UnicodeDecodeError`),
  100000-deep (`RecursionError`), a missing path or a directory, and accepted a float, 2^53+1 or a lone surrogate with a
  recomputed digest.
- **Strict base64url / base64**: SD-JWT segments and producer-block values must be canonical (alphabet, length, padding,
  trailing bits). 1.0.2 stripped whitespace and added padding silently, and a space inside a producer signature still
  verified (`sigsuite._unb64` was `b64decode`).
- **One CLI grammar** with the sibling verifiers: `--help`/`-h` (exit 0 before), `--`, an empty or flag-like value at any
  occurrence, an abbreviated flag, a value on a boolean flag, a second positional = usage (exit 2, no verdict); `--flag=value`
  accepted. The relying-party policy is now on the CLI: `--trusted-producer-key ALG=B64` (repeatable), `--require-producer`,
  `--require-pq`, `--require-anchor` (they existed in the API only).
- **Independent verifier** `verifiers/js/ap2-verify.mjs` (Node, `node:crypto` only): ES256, SD-JWT disclosures, KB-JWT,
  bindings, producer Ed25519 / ECDSA P-256 / ML-DSA-65 (OpenSSL ≥ 3.5, else SKIP = incomplete), RFC 3161 status +
  messageImprint (SPEC §3.2), the same profile and CLI grammar.
- **Differential oracle** `verifiers/differential_oracle.py`: 8 vectors (+1 under `--tsa-cert`) + 39 hostile files + 15 CLI cases
  + 1 positive control = 64, 0 disagreements, 1 declared (TSA proof is openssl-only); 43 red against 1.0.2; a crash counts as
  a disagreement. Review round 1 (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) added the wrong-JSON-shape class (tracebacks in the reference), the
  empty producer block, lenient `tsr_b64` and JWK coordinates, the binder-side base64url mutations and the forged TimeStampResp. Two new vectors with a **real RFC 3161 token** from a probe TSA (certificate shipped):
  `anchor_valid` (ACCEPT) and `anchor_wrong_digest` (a real token for another digest: REJECT) — before, the only anchor
  vector was garbage bytes, so a verifier that never parsed the token passed it.
- RFC 3161: `verified` = status granted + messageImprint equals the digest (BINDING), in both verifiers by a DER walk — a
  self-forged TimeStampResp with the right imprint satisfies it, so it never meant TSA authenticity (1.0.x said
  "cryptographically verify": it ran `openssl ts -reply -text`, which verifies nothing). New `--tsa-cert <PEM>`: the
  reference verifies the token's signature and chain with `openssl ts -verify -CAfile` (`tsa_verified`), required by
  `--require-anchor --tsa-cert`; the JS verifier cannot and does not pass that policy (declared).

- **Review round 2** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): the §3.1 profile now applies INSIDE the SD-JWT (issuer header/payload,
  disclosures, KB-JWT) — the reference read the signed payload with `json.loads` (a duplicate key read last-wins, a BOM
  skipped) while the JS parser refused, so one verifier certified `{"amount":"1","amount":"999"}` as `"999"` and the other
  refused it; present-with-`null` is not absent (`dict.get` vs `??`): `_sd`, `_sd_alg`, `{"...": d}`, disclosure names,
  `cnf`, `cnf.jwk` have imposed shapes; JWK `x`/`y` must be 32 bytes (RFC 7518 §6.2.1 — 31/33 bytes verified in the
  reference, refused in JS); `provenance_class` a string (a list was a `TypeError` in `sorted`); `anchored` a boolean
  (`[]` was "not anchored" in the reference and "anchored, unverified" in JS); `sig_alg` a string (`"constructor"` under a
  pinned key crashed the JS verifier on its prototype-bearing table, now `Object.create(null)`; a list was a `TypeError`
  in the reference); an empty EXPLICIT `[0]` in the TimeStampResp was an `IndexError` traceback. Oracle: 90 cases,
  0 disagreements, 1 declared; `proto-key` case rehashed so that it
  can fail; a declared divergence that stops appearing is reported. README: the Node requirement is OpenSSL ≥ 3.5 for
  ML-DSA-65 (not "Node ≥ 20"); the JS conformance test SKIPS on a build without ML-DSA instead of failing.
- **Review round 3** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `artifacts[].name` must be a non-empty unique string (refusal) — the
  JS binding table was a prototype-bearing object: an absent name was a `TypeError` crash, an int name was stringified
  (`bindings_ok` false against the reference's `true`), `"__proto__"` set the prototype and vanished (valid in the
  reference, not in JS); the JS DER length used `<<` (int32): a 4-byte length `84 80 00 00 00` went negative, passed the
  overrun check and a TimeStampResp the reference refuses verified in JS; the bare invocation of the reference printed its
  help on stdout with exit 2 (now stderr, like every usage path and the JS verifier); the oracle's usage rule is exit 2 AND
  nothing on stdout. Oracle: 97 cases, 0 disagreements, 1 declared; positive controls 5 red on the round-2 state, 26 on the
  round-1 state, 71 on 1.0.2.
- **Review round 4** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `bindings` is compared as a SET in both verifiers (SPEC §4 now defines
  the entry schema, the claim-path grammar and both encodings) — JavaScript's `Object.keys` enumerates array-index keys
  (`"0"`, `"2"`) before the others, so a cart committing under `intent_hash` and `"0"` was scanned in a different order and
  the ORDERED comparison gave `valid: true` in the reference and `false` in the JS verifier on a pack `build` had produced.
  The ablation is now one layer at a time (ablating strict base64url alone had left the unit suite green — that layer was
  not measured; three base64url cases added). The probe TSA certificate is re-issued for 20 years and the two anchor tokens
  with it (it expired in 2 days, so `tsa_verified` would have gone false in 48 hours); the reference validates the chain at
  the token's own `genTime` (`openssl ts -verify -attime`), both verifiers report `rfc3161.gen_time`; the stale
  `requires: ["openssl"]` is off the anchor vectors (the binding check needs no openssl). Oracle: 102 cases,
  0 disagreements, 1 declared; positive control 2 red on the round-3 state.
- **Review round 5** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `provenance_class` is RECONCILED with the signed header instead of
  believed — relabelling `jwk_header` as `x5c_header` made `self_asserted_only` false with no `x5c` anywhere (the one
  field the honest scope sends the auditor to), and out-of-enum values passed as strong classes; the enum is closed in
  both verifiers. `evidence_format` and the §1 MUSTs (`subject`, `created_utc`, `honest_scope`) are checked: a
  `ap2-evidence-pack/2.0` pack used to be verified under the 1.0 rules (version confusion) and a pack with no
  `honest_scope` produced a receipt with `honest_scope: null`. The binding scan uses an inverse index instead of a
  per-leaf loop over the artifacts — the cost was quadratic (measured: 0.70 s at 2 000 artifacts, 5.04 s at 4 000;
  after: 0.009 s and 0.015 s, 0.071 s at 16 000); the set of bindings is unchanged. `build` refuses an empty artifact
  name (it used to write a pack, exit 0, that both verifiers then refused) and its CLI validates `name=path` pairs and
  reports unreadable files as usage (exit 2) instead of a `FileNotFoundError` traceback. The oracle now compares the
  eleven normative fields of SPEC §6 plus `provenance_classes` (it compared seven; `provenance_classes` really did diverge, sorted by code point
  in the reference and by UTF-16 code unit in JS — the JS side now uses the same comparator) and runs 113 cases,
  0 disagreements, 1 declared; the file-level ablation is applied at its use site (patching `loads_strict` also ablated
  the JWT level, since `_loads_segment` delegates to it); two tests that claimed "in both verifiers" now skip instead of
  passing when node is absent, and the bare-invocation loop really runs the JS CLI. Three vector descriptions realigned
  with the code (they still said "neither verifier validates the TSA chain", "cryptographic token verification" and
  "the one ACCEPT of the set").
- **Review round 6** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): the JS "JWT header and payload must be objects" check had ended up
  INSIDE an unterminated line comment in round 5 — a signed payload that is a JSON array verified there and failed in the
  reference; it is code again, and the oracle case that was supposed to cover it (`payload-list-rehashed`) turned out to
  swap the segment without re-signing, so both verifiers failed on the signature and the shape rule was never reached:
  the payload/header shape cases are now built as freshly SIGNED packs. The `x5c` leaf is decoded with the strict base64
  decoder in the reference (`base64.b64decode` dropped a space or newline, the JS verifier refused the same bytes) and the
  `x5c_header` branch, which had no coverage at all, gets four oracle cases with a real self-signed leaf. A stray
  `unittest.main()` in the middle of `test_ap2_evidence.py` meant 13 of its 27 tests never ran in CI (holder binding,
  producer content binding, x5c chain limits): removed, and CI now fails if a module collects fewer tests as a script than
  as a module. `created_utc` is imposed as ISO-8601 UTC in both verifiers (SPEC §1 said MUST, only the type was checked).
  Oracle: 121 cases, 0 disagreements, 1 declared; positive control 3 red on the round-5 state.
- **Review round 7** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `self_asserted_only` is FAIL-CLOSED (SPEC §6.7). Round 5 reconciled
  two of the six spellings of `provenance_class`; the other four still cleared the flag with no evidence at all —
  measured: `"supplied"` and `"jwks_fetched"` cleared it on the strength of the label, and `null` or a DELETED field
  cleared it by making the class set empty. Since `producer_signatures` sits outside the digest, an unsigned pack is
  freely editable, so the one field the honest scope sends the auditor to was the pack author's to choose. Now the class
  is REQUIRED and in the enum (absent/null/other = refusal of that artifact), and the flag is true unless every key was
  reconciled to a certificate leaf that someone else issued — a self-signed `x5c` leaf is still self-asserted. `build`
  no longer tracebacks on an `x5c` leaf wrapped at 76 columns, a non-certificate, a non-string entry or an unreachable
  JWKS (bare `ValueError`/`URLError` escaped `except Ap2EvidenceError`): they are `{"error": …}` receipts, exit 1. The
  oracle compares `rfc3161.gen_time` too and gets a CA-issued `x5c` leaf as the positive control of the honesty flag
  (122 cases, 0 disagreements, 1 declared); an unparseable token returns the same receipt shape in both verifiers; the
  ablation checks the patched module still imports, so a botched patch cannot masquerade as a red ablation.
- **Review round 8** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): round 7 had moved the author's freedom one field along — it cleared
  `self_asserted_only` when the leaf's issuer DN differed from its subject DN, and **measured**: a certificate SELF-SIGNED
  with its own key, declaring `CN=DigiCert Global Root CA` as issuer, cleared the flag in both verifiers on a `valid` pack.
  Offline, "issued by someone else" is not establishable, so nothing clears the flag any more except an `x5c` chain that
  validates to a trust anchor the relying party supplies: new `--trust-anchor <PEM>` (`openssl verify` in the reference,
  `chain_verified` true/false; the JS verifier cannot validate chains and reports `null` — the second declared divergence,
  like `--tsa-cert`). A refusal receipt now carries `self_asserted_only: true` as well (it printed the green value, `false`,
  on a file the verifier had refused to read). `honest_scope` is pinned by SHA-256 to the canonical scope of the declared
  `evidence_format` in both verifiers: the receipt used to REPRINT whatever scope the file carried, so an author could write
  "anchored by a QTSP under eIDAS art. 45j" and see it beside `valid: true`. Oracle: 124 cases, 0 disagreements,
  2 declared.
- **Review round 9** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `created_utc` was validated with `\d`, which in Python matches every
  Unicode Nd digit and in JavaScript only `[0-9]` — measured: `"٢٠٢٦-٠٩-٢٢T٠٠:٠٠:٠٠Z"` verified in the reference and was
  refused by the JS verifier, opposite verdicts on a pack in profile (non-ASCII text is in profile by §3.1). `--trust-anchor`,
  added in r8, was outside the reference's CLI grammar: `--trust-anchor ""` gave a verdict on stdout there and usage exit 2
  in JS. The x5c chain was validated at the CURRENT clock, so a leaf valid 2020-2021 — the ordinary case for a format whose
  claim is "verifies offline years later" — could never clear `self_asserted_only`; it is now validated at the `genTime` of a
  TSA-verified token when the pack carries one, like the TSA chain since r4. `chain_verified` is tri-state (`null` when
  openssl is absent: unmeasurable is not failed) and present in refusal receipts, which lacked it while the JS ones had it.
  Both verifiers now report `artifacts[].x5c_leaf` (subject and issuer DN, serial, validity, SHA-256): a cleared flag means
  a CA under the relying party's anchor certified that key, never that the key belongs to the mandate's issuer — without the
  DN an auditor cannot tell `CN=the-bank` from `CN=attacker`. Oracle: 129 cases, 0 disagreements, 2 declared; positive
  control 4 red on the round-8 state, plus a unit test for the expired leaf measured red there.
- **Review round 10** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026): `self_asserted_only` was computed with `all()` over the per-artifact
  flags, so ONE reconciled artifact cleared it for the whole pack — measured: a pack whose mandate carried a self-asserted
  `jwk_header` key and whose second artifact chained to the relying party's anchor reported `self_asserted_only: false`,
  i.e. "no self-asserted key here", while the mandate-signing key had never been reconciled at all (and the JS verifier
  said `true`: an undeclared divergence the oracle could not see). It is `any()` in both now. The reference asserted
  `granted: false` on a truncated token whose PKIStatus it had already read as granted; both verifiers now carry the status
  that was actually read into the failure path, or `null`. The JS receipt did not carry the leaf validity that SPEC §6.7
  requires, and rendered DNs in OpenSSL multi-line form while the reference used RFC 4514 — the same certificate produced
  two different receipts in the field §6.7 asks for precisely to tell `CN=the-bank` from `CN=attacker`; RFC 4514 in both.
  The oracle now compares `rfc3161.granted`, `rfc3161.imprint_ok`, `chain_verified` and the `x5c_leaf` identity: 130 cases,
  0 disagreements, 3 declared, and **10 red** against the round-9 state. README: 19 CLI cases, not 16.
- **Self-audit before release** (22/09/2026, on the error classes committed during these rounds): the README's "hostile
  files" count had gone stale a third time (97 against 99 measured), so the oracle now PRINTS its own decomposition
  (`9 vector runs + 99 hostile files + 3 positive controls + 19 CLI cases = 130`) and the public numbers are copied from a
  measurement instead of counted by hand. A trailing `//` comment swallowed the rest of its line twice in one day — a shape
  check, then `policy_ok` — so `test_both_receipts_carry_the_same_field_names` now compares the KEY SETS of the two
  receipts (top level, per artifact, `rfc3161`, and on a refusal), measured red against the previous commit; it caught
  `mldsa_backend`, emitted by the JS verifier alone and documented nowhere, which is now in both receipts and in SPEC §6.
  Last of the "asserted but not measured" class: `granted` is `null`, not `false`, when `tsr_b64` never decoded and no
  PKIStatus was ever read. Checked and clean: no hostile oracle case shares the intact vector's verdict tuple.
- **Review round 11** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, 22/09/2026), the last before the release: the sealed `honest_scope` said the
  format "does NOT validate x5c chains to a trust anchor", which round 8 had made false — so a `verify --trust-anchor`
  printed `chain_verified: true` in the same JSON object as a scope denying that chains are ever validated. The scope is
  pinned by SHA-256, so correcting it invalidates every existing pack: it was done now, before the tag, and the whole
  vector set was regenerated with fresh keys and two re-issued RFC 3161 tokens (the declared genTime in the oracle moved
  with them — the run reported the mismatch instead of passing silently, which is what that guard is for).
  `chain_verified` no longer collapses to `null` because a pack also contains a non-x5c artifact: only artifacts that
  attempted a chain count, so a mandate/cart pack mixing `jwk_header` and `x5c_header` now reports what was measured —
  the round-10 `all()` defect one field over, and invisible to the oracle because the JS verifier always answers `null`.
  `imprint_ok` is `null` wherever no messageImprint was read (it asserted `false`, the same accusation round 10 made of
  `granted`, applied to half the object), and the two early `return`s of the JS token walk carry the same fields as every
  other branch. The reference emits `x5c_leaf.chain_verified` always, as the JS receipt did: the same certificate was
  producing a six-field receipt on one side and a seven-field one on the other. Oracle: 130 cases, 0 disagreements,
  4 declared.

- **Final check before the tag** (Fable 5.1, 22/09/2026): three public sentences were false of the measurements and one
  rule the verifiers enforce was missing from the SPEC. `self_asserted_only` printed its GREEN value on a pack with zero
  artifacts (`any()` over an empty list) — the honesty flag is fail-closed there too now, in both verifiers, held by
  `test_honesty_flag_and_scope_are_fail_closed` measured red against the previous commit. Both verifiers refused a
  rewritten `honest_scope` citing "SPEC §1", but the SPEC carried neither the canonical text nor its hash: §1 now pins it
  by SHA-256 and §8 reproduces it verbatim, so an independent implementation can enforce the rule from the text alone.
  The sealed scope itself said "nothing about a chain is sealed in this file" (the x5c bytes are sealed; the validation
  RESULT is not) and that an RFC 3161 token attests the TSA's clock without adding that this holds only once the relying
  party verifies the TSA signature — both corrected, which changed the pinned hash a second time and regenerated the
  vectors again. Stale numbers fixed: the ablation is 1 error + 1 failure on the first layer, the declared divergences are
  three `--trust-anchor` packs plus the `--tsa-cert` one, and the hostile-file list named three cases that do not exist.

- **After the second final pass** (22/09/2026): the sealed scope promises the KB-JWT `aud`/`nonce`/`iat` are RECORDED
  whenever a KB-JWT is present. Measured: neither verifier recorded them on the branch where the KB-JWT carries no
  `cnf.jwk` — the reference returned early with a `note`, the JS verifier without one, so the two receipts differed in
  shape there as well. Both record them on every branch now, with identical fields, and the receipt-shape test covers a
  pack that carries a KB-JWT (red against the previous commit). Found by checking the branch the tests did not reach.
  That prompted a coverage measurement of the whole reference under the tests AND the oracle — 79% of its lines — which
  named `verify_kb_jwt` as the least exercised path. Probing its six uncovered branches found another defect, shared by
  both verifiers: a KB-JWT whose signature segment is non-canonical base64url verified with `valid: true`, because the
  branch for an unknown holder key returns before the signature is ever decoded, so the §3.1 profile never reached it.
  Both verifiers now apply the profile to all three KB-JWT segments; measured on the previous commit, that pack was
  `valid: true` in both. The same measurement was then redone counting the subprocesses the oracle spawns (85%, not 79%:
  the first figure missed every case the oracle runs out of process — a measuring instrument reading the wrong quantity,
  which is the class this release kept finding). The next largest uncovered region, the seven `resolve_disclosures`
  branches, was probed the same way and found CONCORDANT and correct in both verifiers — no defect there. Both sets are
  oracle cases now: 144 cases, 0 disagreements, 4 declared.

**Breaking: 1.1.0 refuses every pack built by 1.0.x.** The scope statement is sealed and pinned by SHA-256 (SPEC §1/§8),
and it was corrected during the review rounds, so a 1.0.x pack is refused with `honest_scope does not match the canonical
scope of this evidence_format` — measured on a pack built with the `v1.0.2` tree and verified with this one, in both
verifiers. Re-build with 1.1.0: a pack built by this tree is ACCEPT in both verifiers and the
conformance runner exits 0 on all eight vectors.
